# Real-Estate

I completed a front-end projectâ€”a real estate landing page.<br>
Using Flexbox, positions, and media queries, I ensured an eye-catching layout that works well on desktop and mobile.<br>
I'm proud of the visually appealing and user-friendly result.<br>
It boosted my confidence in front-end development, and I'm excited for more challenging projects ahead.

As I worked on the project, I realized that I needed to make sure that the page looked great on both desktop and mobile devices, so I used media queries to adjust the layout and font size based on the screen size.<br>
I also made sure to test the page on various devices to ensure that it looked good on all of them.

Overall, I am very happy with how the landing page turned out.<br>
It is visually appealing and easy to navigate, and I think it will be a great asset to the real estate company.<br>
Working on this project has given me a lot of confidence in my front-end development skills, and I look forward to taking on more challenging projects in the future.
